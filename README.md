# About

This repository contains a collection of shell utilities, including small scripts, functions and aliases.

# Usage

Just clone this repo and source in the `.bashrc` the script you want to use.

# Utils

1. [color](./sh/color): display, convert and get ansi color codes
2. [sr](./sh/sr): search and replace content in multiple files
3. [input](./sh/input): collect user inputs from temporary files using any text editor
4. [menu](./sh/menu): generate interactive menus with pure shell
5. [gif](./sh/gif): record the screen to a `.gif` file using only basic CLI tools
6. [include](./sh/include): easily define local and global sources in your `.bashrc`

# Criteria

The criteria I used to put something here rather than in a separated project is the following:
1. single file script with at most one or two auxiliary functions
2. is not yaml/json configurable
